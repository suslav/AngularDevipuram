All that I see, all that\nI experience, is my own self. This whole world is me, a reflection of myself. I\ncontain this world which has arisen in me as an experience. Space and time are\nthoughts in me. I am not delimited by a subset of my thoughts. So I exist beyond\nspace and time. I am immortal. I am free.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Since I am the\nwhole world and beyond it too, I cannot die. I exist, my awareness exists, when\ntime itself is not there. So I was never born, I can never die.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Since I am the\nwhole world, I am not a part of it, particularly, the part which appears to me\nas my body.

When I am seeing my body\nburn, how could I have died?<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">What is death?\nMoving awareness away from a particular time or place makes that particular time\nor place die. Lack of awareness is death. It\'s like sleeping. But, I wake up in\na different body, casting away all my previous ideas into the waste paper basket\nof the past. Some times, I may pick up a discarded paper from the basket. That\'s\nwhen I remember a past life experience.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">The process of\ndeath is not unfamiliar to me. I can be aware of my foot. Now, I can be aware of\nmy hand. When I am aware of my foot, I am not aware of my hand, I don\'t know if\nit was there. Next moment when I become aware of it, it came to being. Birth\nand death, these are continuously happening every moment. They are painless. I\ncannot be afraid of birth, I cannot be afraid of death, since I am not afraid of\npassage of time. Then why and how can I be afraid of death? Of stoppage of time?\nDeath is my friend not to be afraid of, nor wept for. Death is a celebration, to\nbe enjoyed, like throwing away useless torn clothes.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Death does not\nexist. Nor does birth. Nor does growth. The world is a constant invariant. That\ncontains all experiences which flow in time. It is full when time flows. It is\nempty when time does not flow.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Whatever I see is\nmyself. This is a fundamental truth. From this all possible interpretations of\ntruth flow. What is truth?<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Truth is that\nwhich is not limited by space, time or matter. It exists everywhere, always, in\nevery thing.

Truth is also called existence (Brahma), consciousness (Shiva), and\nbliss (Vishnu).<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Each aspect of\ntruth implies the other two; so there is only one, the unity of the three. How\nis that?<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Deny existence.\nCan anything that does not exist be conscious or bliss? Deny consciousness. Can\nanything exist or be blissful? Deny bliss. Can any consciousness or existence be\nwithout pain or pleasure or peace (all three aspects of bliss)? So each implies\nthe other two. They are all one.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">I love myself. I\nam the world. Put these two together.

Now I get the idea: love overcomes hate, it is the answer\nto hate.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">I believe in\nmyself.

This is sometimes called surrender.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Suppose a part of\nme, say my little finger of my leg is hurting. I don\'t take a stone and hurt it\nmore, because it is hurting me. On the contrary, I take pains to nurture it, to\nrelieve the pain. Suppose someone hurts me badly. That one is a part of me. It\nis my duty to nourish that one, remove the ignorance there. All I have to do to\nremove my hurt, my injury is to take away my awareness from that experience.\nThat gives me an idea; my awareness gives energy to a thought.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">My awareness is\nlike a magnifying glass. It amplifies what I focus it on. It manifests that, by\nnot lending my awareness. I will not afford the luxury of allowing negative\nthoughts. Because they are nourished by awareness, they grow on it, they\nmanifest it, they attract everything that increases that particular brand of\nnegativity.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">The answer to\nviolence is love and reconstruction of the lost links of communication.

Is it not like my hand taking\na soap and washing other parts of my body to help them become fresh?<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">I love to see\nbeauty all around me. I love to see people\'s happiness. It is my commitment to\nsee every living being happy. I nourish my love by expressing it, not containing\nit. The more I give love, the more I get it.

Not silently in my\nmind, but by and through actions.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">I nourish my\nnegatives, such as fears, lust, anger, greed, possessiveness, pride, jealousy\nand hatred by containing them, not expressing them. I transform them into\nfearlessness, love, calm, sharing, letting go, humility, fun and regard\nrespectively by not lending my awareness or thinking to them.<O:P>\n </font>\n </O:P>\n\n'),(2,'Some Impressions on Kundalini','<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">What is Kundalini?<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Kundalini is the\npower of coherent awareness, which moves snake like; hence called the SERPENT\nPOWER. It is spontaneous, unpremeditated, subconsciously motivated action. It\nhas its own laws of working. It can defy gravity easily. It is life itself,\nwhich possess awareness.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">That it can defy\ngravity is very easy to see. When you get up from the chair, your center of\ngravity goes up, against gravity. All life exhibits this property. The closest\nexamples I can think of to describe the power of Kundalini are the following:<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Have you seen the\nmovie called ABYSS? If not see it. In the deep down of the ocean, the movie\nvisualizes a coherent wave of water. This water mass, moving snake like, is\nfully aware. It is intelligent, conscious. It can understand, imitate and make\nfaces. It is loving and compassionate. If approached with violence or hate, it\nlashes out with tremendous disruptive force. It can raise against gravity. it is\ncapable of breathing life into a dead person and give the most delightful of\nvisionary experiences. Its harmony is, to put it mildly, unbelievable. The\nsupreme harmony stems from its coherence.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">The second example\nI can cite is the not so familiar quantum fluid-liquid Helium II. Forming at\nvery very low temperatures almost close to absolute zero degrees Kelvin, it\nstems from the NON-LOCAL nature of the wave function of the Helium atom. Hence\nit tends to de-localize, spread, overlapping other atoms. It is almost as if its\nlove expanded to include all its neighbors. At low temperatures where disorder\nis low, the combined wave function exhibits coherence. It climbs up the walls of\nits container, defying gravity, almost like a conscious being. Super\nconductivity is also a similar phenomenon, which I won\'t describe here.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">The third example\nI can think of is the familiar laser beam. One light quantum stimulates another\nto be in step with it. Preserving the integrity of the wave is the essence of\nthe laser beam. Here again the coherence comes through the harmony of the\nindividual light quanta working together.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">The fourth example\nis that of Holography. A hologram is formed when every element of it contains in\nit the information about the whole picture.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">When we look at\nall these examples, one point becomes clear. Coherence is the HARMONIOUS WORKING\nOF INDIVIDUALS, AN EXPRESSION OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY. It comes about by merging:\ntaking a little of the individual and mixing with every other\'s little, allowing\nthe whole to work as a single entity rather than a mere sum of parts. It does\nnot demand individuality to be destroyed; yet it assumes its tremendous impact\nby group harmony. Individual letters group into words, sentences, paragraphs,\npages, etc. Each letter has not lost its individuality, but they are able to\nconvey a message which they are unable to do if they were disordered. A\nmisplaced letter causes confusion. COHERENCE IS THE MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL TO\nTHE HARMONIOUS GROUP CONSCIOUSNESS. Each one does exactly what is right. The\nnotion of right and wrong is then simply definable as coherent or disruptive\naction.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Coherent,\npurposive behavior, not unbridled, random disruptive behaviors; that then is the\nlife giving, life affirming, life enjoying power of Kundalini. It forces an\nindividual in a group to behave as a harmonious member of the group. It\ndemonstrates that whenever there is unity in diversity, the beginnings of life\nis there. Life is an organization. Kundalini is the discipline that preserves\nthe freedom of the GROUP; it forbids action that disturbs harmony, but preserves\ntotal right to purposive, coherent, joyful action. Kundalini is life itself. It\nwins life from the random disorder of chaos.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">When you function\nas an individual, you cannot harness much power. When you function as a coherent\ngroup, your arms are multiplied, so you can do more; you eyes are multiplied, so\nyou can see more; your feet are multiplied, so you can cover more ground; your\nminds are multiplied, so you can think more; your capacity to act is multiplied,\nso you can achieve more. Coherent knowing, coherent doing in the harmony of a\ncontinuum of goals has this power. we will close for now with this following\nexample:<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Have you been to\nPuttaparthy? When Swami comes, Sai Ram, there is a hushed silence falling over a\ncrowd, even it is a 100,000 strong. All minds are still, all are concentrated on\nlooking at Swami. No doubt, some small ripples of thought arise, like, for\nexample, &quot;I want Swami to look at me.&quot; They pass without causing\nincoherence. This is the miracle of group Kundalini, all tuned by the trigger,\nSai Ram. All satsangs, bhajans are the tuning process for the family of Sai\ndevotees to happen. So, if Sai, meaning the assembly, expresses a wish to build\na hospital, 50 Crore Rupees pour in from a million Sai Ram. That is Kundalini\nworking.<O:P>\n </O:P>\n</font>\n</p>\n'),(3,'Meditation','<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Guruji\'s post-abhishekham talk at Sri\r\nRajarajeswari Peetam, Rochester NY on July 18th 1996....</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Everyone of us exists in two modes, one\r\nwhich I call a localized mode and one which I call a diffused mode. In the\r\nlocalized mode of our existence we are identifying ourselves with our body, mind\r\nor intellect. This is the limited state of our existence. The non-localized,\r\ndiffused, spread-out form of our existence, consists of our consciousness\r\npervading all life forms - plant, animal, bird, the sun, the skies, the stars...\r\neverywhere. There you are a witness to all these things and you are yet none of\r\nthese things. The relationship between these two modes is like that between a\r\ncircle and its center. You cannot have a circle without its starting point, the\r\ncenter. The center is within the circle, it is not attached to the circle. Just\r\nlike when you a sphere through the center, the center is unchanging and the\r\ncircle is always changing. The center has to remain fixed. If the center is\r\nmoving, the circle cannot be formed. There has to be a center. You have to be\r\ncentered on yourself. We need both these states of our existence to discover our\r\nroots, our inner most desires, the purpose of our lives and to be able to\r\nexpress the purpose of our lives through our daily lives.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">You need the non-local diffused mode where\r\nyou are not your body, you are not your mind, you are not your intellect, but\r\nyou are the whole, you have spread yourself, your conscious is part of the\r\nentire universe. You have to get in that state a few times a day. Maybe three\r\ntimes a day. If time does not permit, at least two times a day. It is in the\r\nsilence of the mind that God is known. This has been called <i>sandhyavandhanam</i>\r\n: three times a day you have to take the <i>shakthi</i> up into a transcendental\r\nstate and be there for sometime. In the de localized mode of your functioning,\r\nthe importance is not on the content of information, but on the container of the\r\ninformation. It\'s not how much you know that matters, but how much you can\r\nforget. It is not subject to logical reasoning, not even to emotions. It\'s\r\nbeyond reasoning and emotions. And you have to reach that state.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">I\'d like to say a few words about how to\r\naccess this state, what is called <i>samadhi</i>. You have to make a commitment\r\nin your lives to spend 15 to 20 minutes in the morning and 15 to 20 minutes in\r\nthe evening doing this. Now, you may ask, why do you want us to do this ? We\r\nhave already so many pressures at work. Why should we do this? What do we gain\r\nby doing this? What is in it for me?</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">First of all, we need proof that we need\r\nto do something. Let me give you that proof. Let\'s suppose there is a school, an\r\nelementary school, and there is a teacher at the blackboard. The history teacher\r\ncomes and writes a few lines there. He\'s telling the story of the Ramayana. He\r\nsays, &quot;Once there was a king called Dasaratha&quot;, and writes &quot;Dasaratha&quot;\r\nthere. &quot;... and he had four sons named Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha and\r\nShatrugna&quot;, he continues, and writes their names on the board as well.\r\nAfter a little more story-telling, the class is over. Then the mathematics\r\nteacher comes, and he writes the equation (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab on the board\r\nand he explains the meaning of this and he goes away. The student, when he goes\r\nback home, has the following information in his mind: Dasaratha = (a+b)^2, Rama=a^2,\r\nLakshmana =b^2, Bharatha = 2ab, and Shatrugna is nothing.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">It is not only the chalk piece that puts\r\nthe information in your mind that is important, but also the duster. If you do\r\nnot clean your mind of the information you have received, the selected\r\ninformation that\'s going to get into the mind gets mixed up and there is lot of\r\nconfusion in your mind. If we do not let our minds be cleared at least twice a\r\nday, then we cannot have clear perception. Which is more important, the chalk\r\npiece or the duster? Without the chalk piece you are stupid, without the duster\r\nyou are confused. You need both. You need the chalk piece, the world, which\r\nwrites the information on your mind and you have to be able to clear it also.\r\nThe clearing process of the conscious part of the mind and being able to remain\r\nthoughtless for some time is the duster. We need both these things. This is one\r\naspect. The other aspect is that once you are really able to achieve silence of\r\nthe mind, stop all the dialogues, all the monologues in your mind, then you\r\nenter a state called yoga : <i>Yogah cittabuddih nirogah</i>.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">When all the manifestations of the mind,\r\nthe fluctuations of the mind are subdued then your body identification is gone;\r\nwhen you are in the witness state and only the subject remains, the object has\r\nmerged into the subject. The object is not there, because the subject has become\r\nthe object. We are seeing the world and we have become the world and you stop\r\nseeing yourself. That is the state which is called manolaya - where you have\r\neliminated your mind. You have got to try to reach that state, three times a day\r\npreferably. If you can manage a wink at the office, nothing like that. If you\r\ncan\'t, at least do it twice, once in the morning and once in the evening. It is\r\nnecessary in this day of high tension living, high pressure work; you need this\r\nrelaxation process.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">What are the steps that lead to the\r\nrelaxation of the mind? I think there are basically four steps involved. If we\r\neat heavily and then sit down for meditation, what happens? We sleep like\r\nKumbakarna. Kumbakarna is a guy who sleeps for six months continuously. If you\r\nare totally hungry, with the burning sensation in the stomach, you can\'t sit and\r\nmeditate. So a slight hunger should be there, but not too much.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">If your mind is totally fresh, you have\r\njust woken up from sleep, and you want to sit for meditation, the mind wants to\r\nthink. It has finished it\'s sleep. It wants to become active. That doesn\'t\r\ncreate the slope that is necessary for the mind to settle down into a\r\nthoughtless state. So, if you are totally fresh, again, it is a conducive state\r\nfor meditation. The second important step is that as you should have a little\r\nhunger, you should have a little tiredness also. When your body is tired and\r\nyour mind is tired, the mind wants to stop thinking and start relaxing. This\r\nwill set up a small slope in the mind and it starts gently rolling down. If you\r\ntake a bottle, fill it with water and put some mud in it and shake it well and\r\nlet it stand, it will start settling down. The settling down is because the mind\r\nhas naturally a tendency to be lazy. So you try to go into a state of non\r\nthinking in a natural gradient.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">But what happens is that when you sit for\r\nmeditation, some kind of disturbance or the other, some trigger comes. A little\r\nsound, and you start analyzing what that sound is. It starts a train of thought.\r\nSo when you have these trains of thought, it\'s like a ball that is rolling down\r\nthe slope of a hill comes across an obstacle. It stops there. It doesn\'t roll\r\ndown further. Or sometimes the obstacle is such that it pushes it up. So, what\r\ndo you have to do?</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Have you observed that no thought has\r\nnever remained all the time with you? Is there any thought that has remained\r\nforever with you? No, not a single thought. All thoughts come, they are born,\r\nthey grow, and they die in your mind. The nature of the obstacles in your\r\nthoughtless state are the thoughts. If you observe that the thoughts are\r\ntemporary in nature, they will never stay for long, they cannot. The mind has a\r\nnatural tendency to kill them. What do you have to do? Remain a passive witness\r\nto the thought, don\'t get involved with the thought. Don\'t invite the thought,\r\nput it on a pedestal and do puja like you do to Devi. Nor do you ask the thought\r\nto go away. If you push it away, you are working with the emotion of the\r\nthought. &quot;This is a bad thought, I should not be having it&quot;. Why do\r\nthese thoughts come to me when I am trying to clear my mind? I should have only\r\ngood thoughts, not bad thoughts&quot;. So, suspend your judgment of these\r\nthoughts. Your judgment that this is good or bad, this is what I should have,\r\nthis is what I should not have, is a thought. If I think it is a good idea, then\r\nI want to hang on to it, if I think it is a bad idea, I want to push it away\r\nfrom me. Thoughts are not the problem, your judgment of your thoughts is. If you\r\njudge not, then you are in a passive state of mind, a witness state of mind. A\r\nwitness is not affected. If my name is Sastry, I can witness this guy Sastry\r\nhaving this thought, that\'s not me, I am witnessing this fellow having this\r\nthought. Take yourself a little away from yourself. Detach yourself a little.\r\nAnd without judgment, let the thought come, let it stay as long as it wants, let\r\nit go if it wants to. Let a new thought come, let it go.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">We talked about three aspects. The first\r\nis a little hunger, then a little tiredness to set the slope of the mind. And\r\nthe obstacles in the way of reaching the settling of the mind are the judgment\r\nof the thoughts and therefore you remain a witness to the thoughts, not judging\r\nthem.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">There is one more important thing. This is\r\nthe most important. We accept or we say we accept God. But we do not accept His\r\ncreation. We start asking, &quot;If there is a God then why in the name of\r\nHeaven does He create all this misery, all these pressures ? Why should He\r\nreward the impious and why should He punish the virtuous? Why should He allow\r\nthose hapless 220 people to die in the plane crash? He doesn\'t know how to make\r\nthe world !&quot;</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">We are not accepting His creation for what\r\nit is. They say there are three pivots for a stable mind : <i>bhakthi</i>, <i>gnana</i>\r\nand <i>vairagya</i>. Bhakthi is devotion, Gnana means knowledge and vairagya\r\nmeans detachment. In my opinion, bhakthi and vairagya are not different from\r\neach other. They are one and the same. Being able to accept God\'s creation, good\r\nor bad, whatever it is, as being perfect, that is surrender to God. We thank God\r\nthat we receive gifts from Him. We ridicule God when we receive brickbats from\r\nHim. We should be able to thank Him both when we are in misery and when we are\r\nin pleasure. This equanimity is surrender to God\'s will. Not surrendering to\r\nGod\'s will is criticizing it, and saying, &quot;If only I had the power I would\r\ncreate a better world.&quot; What kind of a world will I create? I will create a\r\nblank white paper. Well, no color, no contrast, everything is fine...there\'s no\r\npicture there. God is the picture of this world. God is His creation. God is the\r\nearth, He is the sorrow, He is the misery, He is the pleasure, He is the pain.\r\nHe is everything. So accepting God is accepting God\'s creation also. What does\r\nthis imply that applies to meditation?</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Sometimes the meditation goes wonderfully,\r\nabsolutely no problems, I\'m in seventh heaven, walking on the rainbows, with the\r\nMother leading me with Her little finger and showing me different worlds. They\r\nare singing for me, they are dancing for me - an aesthetic state of union with\r\nGod. And sometimes nothing happens. It is just routine. Where does boredom come\r\nfrom? Because you have an expectation that something is going to happen, and\r\nwhen that something does not happen, then you are bored. It\'s not helping you,\r\nand you lose interest in the meditation. So you have to understand that\r\nexpectation is the cause for the disappointment. Expectation is the cause of the\r\nboredom. So what is it that you have to do ? You should have no expectations\r\nwhatsoever about how the meditation is going to proceed. If you have no\r\nexpectations, no disappointments. If you have expectations, you will have\r\ndisappointments.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">So, to reach that thoughtless state of the\r\nmind, spend about 20 minutes in the morning and in the evening. I am not asking\r\nyou to do mantra japa. Mantra japa is a thought. That is also an addiction; you\r\nare going to get rid of it one day. You may use it for sometime, but then when\r\nthe mind starts getting cleared, you have to let go of that too. A little\r\ntiredness, a little hunger, non-expectation of the results and being a witness\r\nto your thoughts. These are the four essential conditions that are necessary for\r\nsettling the mind down to a quiet state. All that is needed is that your mind\r\nsettles down to a quiet state and once you have learnt the trick of how to go\r\nabout doing this, it comes naturally to you. This is the duster which you have\r\ngot to apply once in the morning and once in the evening. You choose your time.\r\nBut try to see if you can stick to the same time everyday because it builds up a\r\nhabit. Try to see if you can create an environment around yourself where not\r\nmuch of external disturbance is present. Try to see that you are not over full\r\nor over eaten, try to be comfortable. Take a simple posture where you can forget\r\nyour body, don\'t contort yourself into a position which you cannot hold for any\r\nlength of time without discomfort. If you are used to yogasanas, that\'s a\r\ndifferent story. But otherwise what you do is <i>sukhasana</i> : whatever asana,\r\nwhatever posture is convenient for you, where your body doesn\'t keep hurting you\r\nand bringing you back to your body consciousness. What you are trying to do is\r\nforget the body, forget the mind. But not going to sleep.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">So, this is called Sandhyavandhanam. There\r\nare several mantras we know...there is <i>pancadashi</i> the 15 letter mantra, <i>shodashi</i>\r\nthe 28 letter mantra, then there is <i>balatripurasundari shadakshari</i> - <i>aim\r\nkleem souh souh kleem aim</i>, and then you have <i>hamsa - soham</i> mantra and\r\nthe <i>shuddha pranavam AUM</i>. Then there are the <i>mahavakyas</i>. And\r\nbeyond all these things, there is the silence of the mind. There you don\'t have\r\nHer to hold on to, the sastras say <i>niralamba margah</i> . There is no\r\nsupport, support less you have got to be. Any kind of support that you try to\r\nhang on to does not give you independence. If you are seeking any kind of\r\nsupport, whether it is the guru, whether it is the mantra or whether it is an\r\nexpectation, nothing, you have got to let go of everything. You have to be\r\nyourself, without expectations, and try to remain in that state. All these\r\nrituals that we do are to help us to reach a state of mind where it is balanced.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Having practiced this, I have known that\r\nit is in that state that clarity of perception comes. It is in that state that\r\nuniversal love springs forth in your heart. It is in that state that you are\r\nable to feel the oneness with entire universe. It is in that state that you are\r\nat the bottom of the ocean of awareness. There you see the oneness, not the\r\ndiversity. It is in that state that you start feeling that when you give to\r\nsomebody, you not giving to somebody else, you are giving to myself. In that\r\nstate you will know for certain, that when I improve myself, I am improving the\r\nworld around me. It is in that state you will understand that if I am helping\r\nmyself, I am helping the world. We have an equation - I am You - that is\r\nestablished in that state of non localized mode of existence.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">We are very much used to the localized\r\nmode of existence and we\'ve forgotten that we can exist in the other mode. In\r\nphysics, we have got what is called the quantum phenomenon. There is the\r\nparticle mode of existence and there is the wave mode of existence. This applies\r\nto you. Your mind is a quantum phenomenon. It knows of no distance nor time, it\r\nknows of no path, it jumps from this to that without being in the intermediate\r\nstate of time or space. In the classical model, if I want to go from Rochester\r\nto New York, we can put the sentries on the way, at Syracuse, at Troy, Albany\r\nand then New York. And you can say, he has just crossed Syracuse, now he has\r\ncrossed Troy, now he has crossed Albany before getting to New York. In quantum\r\nmode of travel, this does not happen. What happens is that you disappear here\r\nand you appear there. That\'s how the mind functions. The mind being a quantum\r\nphenomenon, the classical model of continuous path does not have to apply. The\r\nmind being a quantum phenomenon, it can disappear being an individual, become a\r\nwave, dematerialize here and materialize there. You\'ve got to learn how to be a\r\nparticle, you\'ve got to learn how to be a wave. We have learned how to be a\r\nparticle throughout our lives, what we have to learn is how to become a wave. So\r\nI hope that you will practice this, and perhaps I can talk about this again.\r\nI\'ve got tomorrow and I\'ve got, maybe the Guru pournami day.</font></p>\r\n<p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">We\'ll meet again. Thank you for listening\r\nto me patiently. God Bless You.</font></p>\r\n'),(4,'Kundalini Sadhana: A fine art of Healing','<font color=\"#cc3300\">Kundalini\r\nSadhana: </font> </u></b><font color=\"#cc3300\"><u><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt\">A\r\nfine art of Healing</span></b></u><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\"><br>\r\n</b></font></span><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt\"><br>\r\n</span></font></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">My\r\ndear friends,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am writing to tell you about healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually we make two mistakes. One is that we think with the mind. Second is that\r\nwe think using language which linearizes the thought. The very first of\r\nPatanjali\'s yoga sutras says, &quot;stop the vortices of thoughts. Stop thinking\r\nabout the same things again and again, going in circuits. That is Yoga.&quot;\r\nThe grand question is how can one stop thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to say that we don\'t have to stop thinking, but we do have to think\r\nin a different way. We normally think with the mind. Stop that. Instead, think\r\nwith the body. Think with the body? Yes, think with the body. Shift the thinking\r\nto a place other than the mind. Where else than body? (Well, there are other\r\nanswers, but for the moment this answer will do.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have to understand that there is an intelligence in the body. Body is also\r\nmind. It can be aware. It is the pathway to mind. The pathways can be aware\r\nthemselves. They are the precursors to thoughts. You can easily observe the way\r\nthe vibrations, currents, vortices, feelings, move and circulate in your body.\r\nNot only in the head, but also in various parts of your body. The paths have the\r\nsame intelligence as the mind. This is the basis of the statement: stop thinking\r\nwith the mind, start thinking with the body. Let go of the mind. Don\'t analyze.\r\nJust be aware of what the body is telling you to do, do it. Then both knowing\r\nand acting are thoughtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does a child think? With the body. It has not learned language; to name,\r\nanalyze, cognize. But it is aware. It does not know fear. Become a child once\r\nagain. Unlearn what you have learned. This is where I would like to begin the\r\nsadhana or practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI request the Goddess, Devi, to bless you to heal yourself. As Devi, I bless\r\nyou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not ask Devi to heal you directly? Because, 1. you should have the desire to\r\nbe healed and act on it; and more important, you may not have accepted it yet,\r\n2. You are Devi yourself. If you say no, Devi is saying no, and so Devi will not\r\nheal you. So you alone can heal yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, assuming you said &quot;yes, I want to be healed,&quot; then here is the\r\nway to act on it. Unless you act on it, healing won’t happen. The process is\r\nquite safe, and I am with you, so don\'t be afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoose a comfortable place to sit or stand. Noise is the biggest distracter.\r\nEven a clock sometimes can be quite troublesome. Choose a very quiet place which\r\nwill not disturb you. Have no witnesses. Only yourself. Don\'t use a chair as it\r\nlimits your freedom. An open stool is OK. Wear some thing very light and loose.\r\nWearing nothing is best, if you are comfortable with it. Draw a circle around\r\nyou, saying, nothing bad can enter here. Imagine a firewall around you like a\r\nglobe. You are in the center of the 4 dimensional (3 dimensions of space and 1\r\ndimension of time) fireball. Say, &quot;I am full of energy here and now. I have\r\nnothing to worry or be afraid of right now. I am not in time any more.&quot;\r\n(Note: I have chosen a 4d fire ball so that astral entities who know the fine\r\narts of moving in time also can\'t disturb you, and you are freed from fear.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am the Shakti in You. I am working in You. I am you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive yourself permission to move. Now start moving your head and neck slowly,\r\never so slowly that you hardly perceive it, but you know you are moving it.\r\nNever force yourself beyond the point of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep moving. The energy inside you will direct you to move in certain ways.\r\nTotally unpredictable. Can you predict how the smoke coming out of a lighted\r\nagarbatti (incense stick) dances in convective patterns in a still place? All\r\nsuch ways are OK. Keep releasing tensions. Let the body do the thinking. Give it\r\na chance to think. Your body has an in-built intelligence. Let it work. Become\r\ntotally aware of the part of your body that is doing the moving under the\r\nguidance of an unknown force. The unknown force is the innate intelligence of\r\nthe body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove your neck. After some time (you will know when) start moving your hands.\r\nMove them any way you like. They are the healing hands. Move them over your\r\nbody, ever so lightly. Feel the touch, the warmth sensually. Give yourself\r\npermission to be sensual. Feel the energy pulsating in the contact between your\r\nhands and your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove like a wave. Or a snake. Poised, ready to strike. Move your head like a\r\nsnake. You are the snake. A snake is not afraid of a snake, is it? It is itself.\r\nWhat is there to be afraid of? Yourself? It is the healing energy that feels\r\nlike a snake - lithe, subtle, forceful, capable of infinite variations in\r\nexpressions. All your fingers have collapsed to a single tip like a bud of a\r\nflower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive an energy bath to all parts of yourself with your hands. All parts. Feel\r\nthe vibrant white light flowing through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo this as long as you like. A typical session may last 20 to 30 minutes. Then\r\nthank yourself, your Guru, Devi, and your environment. Then get out of the\r\nbody-thinking mode, out of the fireball, into the world of time. Into the world\r\nof language. Into the world of linear thinking with the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will start seeing and experiencing the power of this technique. You will be <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">alive</i>,\r\nhealed. Your mind rested. Body healed. Thankful you are alive. Pleased. Peace\r\nwithin you radiates to others. You will be noticed. You will help others without\r\nfear of losing what you have. You will have known the truth, I = world I see.\r\nSoham.<br>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\"></font></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\"><br>\r\nIn normal transactions, you lose what you give. But can you lose if you are\r\neveryone and to whom can you give? Or receive from whom? If there is a\r\ntransaction, it is\r\nbetween yourself and yourself. Like having two bank accounts, money just moved\r\nfrom one to the other. You haven\'t gained, you haven\'t lost. Lakshmi is\r\nSaraswati. The more you give, the more you get. You can\'t give without getting\r\nit back. Then fear of loss of money goes. For this to happen, you must know who\r\nyou are. Now you know that you are everyone. The more you love, the more you are\r\nloved. All love is total “Self”ishness. It is only loving oneself. Because\r\nthere is none other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven death can\'t catch you. When you are seeing your funeral through the eyes of\r\nthe others, are you dead or alive? You can\'t die. Death is a lie. So, fear of\r\ndeath goes. You are permanently dead or permanently alive. Both mean the same\r\nthing. You have moved from being an asura to a sura; one who is wanting\r\nimmortality to one who is immortal. You were already immortal; but thought you\r\nwere mortal; so you sought immortality; gods cannot give you that; they cheat\r\nyou; finally, only you can give yourself that; by becoming aware that the last\r\nstep was the first step; that you are already where you wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that is all it takes to heal. You will feel the powerful healing that has\r\ntaken place. You feel a new awareness permeating every move you make; poised,\r\npurposeful. You will not want to create any turbulence. Even when you open a\r\nfaucet, you will want to make the water flow smoothly, because you have become\r\naware of the violence in a turbulent flow. You will prefer harmony to\r\ndisharmony. Order to chaos. Naturally. You will be a source of joy to others.\r\nLoved, respected, accepted everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will become sensitive to other\'s misery, suffer with them like Jesus.\r\n&quot;O God, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.&quot; Or be\r\nlike Krishna. Enjoy the Gopis, the beauties in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs suffering inevitable? No. You can choose to suffer with others. Or choose to\r\nenjoy with others. The choice is yours. What is your take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe want to heal those who want to be healed. And enjoy those who are healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus healed is Krishna. That is why East and West together sing, Christna,\r\nChristna. Combines both, sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy yourself. Healing is loving yourself. The world is yourself. So you will\r\nnaturally love the world. And the world loves you. Abundance is yours. Without\r\nasking for it, begging for it. Without negotiating for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the message of the Goddess. This is the revelation. It reveals you to\r\nyourself. It is the mirror to what you were and also to what you can be. It\r\nlooks into the past, and into the future at once. It goes beyond the\r\nstraitjacket of time slotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</font>\r\n'),(5,'Deepa Yajna','<font face=\"Century Gothic\" color=\"#990000\" size=\"3\">Deepa\r\nYajna</font></u></b></p>\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Script\r\nfor Villagers to do Deepa Yajna (festival of lights) and Balamandir every New\r\nMoon and Full Moon<br>\r\ndays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Materials needed</u>:<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">A\r\nplate, a glass of water, mango / betel preferred leaves, a vessel, a coconut,\r\nturmeric rice, 2 bananas, flowers of all colors, 1.5 ft wool thread; a mud\r\ncontainer for oil, 2 cotton wicks and matches and Rs 5 (10 cents) to be brought\r\nby each family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(DEEPA YAJNA = festival of lights)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy whatever name you call, only one Godhead answers. His Power is also one with\r\nHim and Supreme. People of all religions worship Godhead through songs. The\r\nbasic set of musical notes is the word of God, called Om. Does Godhead have a\r\nform? Yes. It is not visible, but it is similar to light. This light is actually\r\nlife, which no one can see, but is the light through which everything is seen.\r\nSo light is used by all as a symbol of God\'s form. When people forget their\r\ndifferences and gather to do good to all, it is called a Yajna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYajna is a set of good actions. To get auspicious thoughts and to protect\r\nagainst disturbances disrupting our actions, let us welcome God by saying Om\r\nfive times.&nbsp; Each time before saying Om, take a really deep breath, release\r\nthe breath slowly saying a full throated Om. Pull up your back straight. Keep\r\nyour hands loose and facing up in your lap. Close your eyes. Listen carefully.\r\n(Start Sruti) Merge your voices into Tanpura. Say,&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOm Om Om Om Om (Sruti continues for 30 seconds)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpen your eyes slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYajna is sacred action.&nbsp; Sprinkle water, symbol of life on to your neighbor\'s\r\nheads and your own heads.<br>\r\nSay,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind is now pure. My speech is now pure. My actions are now pure. May this\r\npurity in thought, word and deed lead us to the highway to God, open up our\r\nvision, and bring peace to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen: Sun gives us light and life, like God. We can breathe the Sun\'s life\r\ninto our lungs to enhance our life power. Close your eyes. Take a really deep\r\nbreath and hold it. Say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee the sun passing through white clouds. In every one of my hair follicles, the\r\nlight and life of Sun is spreading. My mind, and heart are filled with light. I\r\nam full of life, happy and contended here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly release your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUseless thinking and feeling unwanted emotions makes our minds hot. To cool it\r\ndown, we need the cool touch and vision of God always between our eyebrows. This\r\nremoves our hot thoughts or emotions. For this purpose, we wet a little bit of\r\nmud, or sandal paste and kumkum and then place it in between eyebrows.<br>\r\nFocus on the coolness there. Say,&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay my mind become calm. May useless emotions and excitements not even enter my\r\nmind.&nbsp; May my head be proud and held high. May my intelligence be clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen: These are difficult days. Miseries pile up like mountains, caused by our\r\nown unthinking actions. They are also caused by unscrupulous people exploiting\r\nour weaknesses or poverty. They make us feel powerless and angry.&nbsp; We do\r\nneed to ask for help from our Creator who is almighty. We&nbsp; ask for\r\nprotection<br>\r\nthrough what is is called Samkalp Sootra or Raksha Bandhan, tied to the wrist.\r\nAdult women please hold in your left hands, the rest of you&nbsp; in right\r\nhands. Hold it up high to make these promises. Say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will obey the commands of my Creator. I will not do undesirable acts. I accept\r\nGodhead\'s blessings as my fortune, happily. I will share my abundance with\r\neveryone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen: Tie the Samkalp Sootra at the wrist to the person next to you. They will\r\ntie it to you. Keep it till the next yajna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe round vessel is a symbol of the world. The coconut on top of it is a symbol\r\nfor head, and the waters in it for life. Decorate the vessel with turmeric and\r\nkumkum. Arrange betel or mango leaves like a lotus on the vessel. Place the\r\ncoconut on top of it. Say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dearest God, unite all of us in doing good to our village.

They unite to generate light which\r\ndestroys darkness, and fills the universe with light. This keeps on going as a\r\nYajna automatically. Whenever we do this together, a great divine power descends\r\non earth. People get attracted to do good paths, light, knowledge, and good\r\nactions. This is the essence of Deepa Yajna, to motivate people to get together\r\nto do good to them and to society. If we perform this Yajna on every full moon\r\nday, you will get abundance; on every new moon day, your poverty, misery, fear,\r\nand apathy will be destroyed. Like a flood, enthusiasm and excitement flow to\r\nregenerate desire to live better, know how to, and to act in coordination to\r\nreach goals you set. The very faces of your villages change, making them better\r\nplaces to live than urban areas in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are now going to light all the lamps; so please be silent. To focus our\r\nawareness, let us all recite Om 5 times after taking deep breaths. Keep your\r\nspine erect. (Start Sruti) Take a deep breath. Say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOm&nbsp; Om&nbsp; Om&nbsp; Om&nbsp; Om&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen: To give peace of mind to those in misery, let us keep silent for ½\r\nminute. (Sruti ends after ½ minute)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow light the lamps taking care not to burn yourselves, or the sarees or hair of\r\nthe ladies in front of you. Keep the wicks separate in oil, but united where\r\nthey emit light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoornahuti<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are about to start poornahuti. This means that we are going to merge our will\r\ninto the will of God. It also means that we are promising to make necessary\r\nsacrifices to achieve the good of our village.

Let us throw them out by\r\nsaying Svaha 3 times forcefully. Say after me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSvaaha.&nbsp;&nbsp; Svaahaa.&nbsp;&nbsp; Svaahaa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen: In every village this Deepa Yajnam and Baala mandir is going on at this\r\nvery moment on every new moon and full moon days. News is spreading about the\r\nbenefits of these community actions to other villages, mandals, districts,\r\nrashtras, our entire country; all are being empowered and enriched this very\r\nmoment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 Promises to give to enrich our village with fire as witness:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListen: Raise the lighted lamp with your both hands under it carefully to be\r\nlevel with your eyes. Be careful not to spill the oil on the ground, or set fire\r\nto your neighbors\' sarees. Keep your attention on the light, not the container\r\nwhile saying the promises. Say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI (say your name, gotram in your mind) am making these promises with fire as\r\nwitness, merging myself into God and so my will is the will of God:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give Health: My body is a temple fit for God to live in. I will keep it\r\nclean and healthy and nourished. I will get rid of my bad habits. Similarly, I\r\nwill protect the health of others. I will dispose of garbage in specified places\r\nto recycle or convert into fertilizer. I will not release bad water on to roads,\r\nbut into soak pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give flowers and fruits: I will earn money by productive activities\r\nappropriate to the village such as raising fruits and flowers, or vegetables, or\r\nstitching clothes, making eco- friendly paper bags etc. If I think that I save\r\nwhat remains after my expenses, it never happens. So I will think of savings as\r\nmy first expense, and save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give to God: I offer what I have earned or saved first to God and then\r\nuse them as appropriate for myself or for village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give Devotion: To prevent bad thoughts, I will pray and sing to God\r\neveryday for at least ½ hour with soulful absorption so that, others who see\r\nwill with devotion. My well being is included in the well being of all. So I\r\nwill do everything possible to help the society in anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give Work: To throw away apathy and laziness, I will work for the village\r\nat least one hour every week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give Education: I will teach at least one person to study. I will give\r\nany kind of help to any school in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI promise to meet here every new moon and full moon day and to perform this\r\ndeepa yajna. We will abide by what we in our village committee decide to give\r\nthe offerings on the 2 weeks following each yajna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe accept God\'s grace in fulfilling His will. May all be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOm, Peace, Peace, Peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis completes the Deepa Yajna, to be followed immediately by Baala Mandir\r\nstreet show by children in age group 10-13 both boys and girls. It explains the concepts\r\nof poverties of seven kinds, and what villagers do to eliminate each of them.\r\nThe substance is elaborated in the seven kinds of giving promised in the Deepa\r\nYajna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach Deepa Yajna sustains enthusiasm for 14 days, to be reinforced by the next.\r\n<O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n'),(6,'Karma, Causality and Freewill','<p align=\"center\"><b><u><font color=\"#990000\" size=\"3\" face=\"Century Gothic\">Karma,\r\nCausality and Freewill</font></u></b><font color=\"#990000\" size=\"3\" face=\"Century Gothic\"><u><O:P>\r\n </u></O:P>\r\n</font></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Friend (F):\r\nGuruji, What is Karma?

It is a very good question. I\r\ndon\'t think I know the answer even partially. But let me try to tell you what\r\nlittle I know.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">What is Karma?\r\nIt says, you reap what you sow. If you sow good thoughts, say good words and do\r\ngood deeds, you get things which makes you happy. If you sow bad thoughts, say\r\nbad words and do bad things, you get things which makes you miserable. It is\r\ntrue, you reap what you sow. But does it say you do not reap what you did not\r\nsow, but other\'s sow? That does not follow. That is very important fact to\r\nremember.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Does it also\r\nsay anywhere that because of Karma, every thing is pre-determined? Is Karma a\r\nlaw of predetermination? Is it like the flow of time, which goes on inexorably\r\nfrom past to present and into future. Even if it was a flow of time like an\r\narrow, it is still not clear how everything including the will to think, speak\r\nand do are completely determined. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">What about the\r\nKarma which you do for the sake of others? Don\'t the others reap what you have\r\nsown for them? If you hit someone, that person feels the blow. The farmer has\r\nsown seeds of rice and vegetables; I enjoy the rice and curry. We have to get\r\nclear about our ideas: not only do we enjoy the fruits of our own actions, but\r\nalso the fruits of other\'s actions impinging on us, making us happy or\r\nmiserable. I am not the sole reason for my state of being. The world has a great\r\nsay in that. In fact I owe my very existence to the act of love between my\r\nfather and mother; when I was not even in their minds, nor did I have much of a\r\nchoice in getting the spark of life. I was an accident. I won a luck dip in\r\nwhich a billion of my possible brothers or sisters who were dead but trying to\r\nget a chance to live. How can we say everything is predetermined even in a\r\nclassical sense?<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">In me there are\r\nbillions of living cells. Like our Sun, there are billions of Suns (called\r\nstars) in in our world. Roughly, I as a human being stands somewhere as a\r\nharmonic mean between the very large and very small systems. Very large systems\r\nare about 24 powers of ten times larger than me; I am 24 powers of ten larger\r\nthan the smallest constituents of matter. I and Universe share the properties of\r\nlarge redundant systems. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">One of the\r\nsignificant properties of large systems is the arrow of time. It seems to be\r\nirreversible, even though the equations of motion of individual particles are\r\nnot sensitive to the direction of flow of time. In the equation: force equals\r\nthe product of mass and acceleration, you can replace &quot;t&quot; by minus\r\n&quot;-t&quot;; yet the equation merrily remains the same because (-dt&nbsp; x -dt=+dt&nbsp;\r\nx&nbsp; +dt). What it means is that considered as an individual particle, you\r\nare perfectly free to move forward or backward in time. Nothing stops you from\r\nthat. Only in a collective sense, you cannot do it. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">This means that\r\neven in a classical sense, you have a freedom. You could go forward or backward\r\nin time. An individual can do that. A person is free to think, speak and do what\r\nshe wants. However, the rules change, if a collective is involved. Statistical\r\nrules come into play. It is very easy to mix up two distantly colored handfuls\r\nof sand masses. To separate the mixture it is very hard. The ease with which we\r\ncan create disorder and the difficultly in creating order puts the arrow on\r\ntime. We say that time flows in the direction of increasing disorder. There is a\r\ncollective Karma, influencing how you tend to behave or ought to behave. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">But listen. A\r\nparticle has two modes of existence; one in which it looks and acts like a\r\nparticle, and another in which it looks and acts like a wave. These are two ways\r\nof looking at the reality. Any one way is not superior or inferior to another.\r\nNow we are moving away from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">A particle\r\nsupposedly exists at one place and time. A wave exists at all places at the same\r\ntime. There is a very interesting relationship between the speeds of a particle\r\nand its wave. The product of the two speeds is c x c , where c is the speed of\r\nlight. It follows that if the speed of the particle is v , which is less than c,\r\nthen the speed of the wave has to be larger than c so that their product remains\r\nthe same. Now another very interesting point comes up.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Any thing going\r\nslower than the speed of light has to go forward in time, into future. And, any\r\nthing moving faster than light has to go back in time, into past. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">So now we have\r\na dilemma. A description of the particle is saying, the particle is moving\r\nslower than light and going into future. Another equally valid description says\r\nthe wave is going into past. Both are same, both are valid representations! One\r\nis moving into disorder; this is the material part. The other is moving into\r\norder; this is the wave part. The funny thing is that both are happening at the\r\nsame time. Are we confronted with conservation of entropy, another form of\r\nenergy?<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Now I am\r\nventuring into uncharted waters. I am leaving science which is concerned only\r\nwith an objective reality independent of any subject. I may not be right; I may\r\nbe quite wrong in fact. From this point on, you may believe or disbelieve. It\r\ndoes not matter; because a fact cannot be reduced to a belief. Go by facts, not\r\nby faith in me. I repeat, I am fallible. You are warned.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">I wish to think\r\nthat the wave representation corresponds to consciousness, or awareness. Since\r\nwaves have the property of superposition, they can interfere with each other\r\nconstructively or destructively at different points. When many waves interfere\r\nconstructively there is a very high degree of order generated. Coherence\r\ncreates, manifests high degrees of order which seem to violate behavior of inert\r\nmatter ( which prefers disorder), described so well by science which has not\r\ntaken the subject into consideration.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">I suppose this\r\nis what Krishna is saying to Arjuna in Gita: whenever disorder increases largely\r\nin the world, I come again, to reestablish order; to protect the pious and\r\ndestroy the confusing. What we are witnessing is a pendulum swinging between\r\norder and disorder, between time going back and forth.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Consciousness\r\nhas power over matter. If I tell you, get up, you simply get up. Your physical\r\nbody by itself cannot do that. It is inert; it cannot violate gravity. But your\r\nconsciousness controls that and allows an impossible event of levitation to\r\nbecome possible. This is a daily miracle, going unnoticed.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Now let us work\r\nwith these ideas. Through my awareness, I can really go back in time; and\r\nthrough my physical body I can come back to the present moment. Let me do a\r\nthought experiment.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Suppose I\r\nbecome coherent (some how, kundalini may help perhaps) wave, I move faster than\r\nlight, go back into a time when my grandfather has not given birth to my father.\r\nAnd I shoot my Grandpa. Now I come back to the present time with or without my\r\nphysical body. Now I ask the question, do I exist or do I not exist?<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Logical time\r\nbased reasoning (shall we call it popular view of Karma?) states that since my\r\nfather never was born, how could I be born to my father? So I don\'t exist. Then\r\nwho is asking the question? I. So I exist. So we see that my ability to use my\r\ntwo representations wisely has enabled me to define two equally valid and\r\nopposite states of my being; namely, 1. it is true that I don\'t exist, and 2. it\r\nis true that I exist. I have created a new possibility, not determined by the\r\nirreversible flow of time, which I call Karma. In fact I have changed my\r\ndestiny; I now have two bodies. One that exists and one that doesn\'t. How\r\nclever! What happened in the time after I shot grandpa and now? May be, because\r\nmy father was not available ( he was not born), my mother could not, and so did\r\nnot marry him, but found some one else. There might have been progeny, a\r\ndifferent scenario altogether. My ability to go back into the past and act there\r\nhas affected not only my destiny, but of so many other people as well, creating\r\na tremendous confusion like a miracle does to us now. We know it is there; we\r\ndon\'t know how it happened. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">If we can move\r\nin time, many impossible things can be done. Put your thinking caps on. You can\r\nwalk through walls. A wall may be a wall for a particle, but is not a wall for a\r\nwave. So an alpha particle, being a wave, doesn\'t have to climb a wall; it can\r\nsimply leak out through the wall.&nbsp; We call this radio-activity. You can\r\nread other\'s minds. Your coherent waves can interact with the thought waves of\r\nothers. You can see through other\'s eyes. You can go to the next galaxy and\r\ncomeback without a space ship before I can blink my eye. A space ship would be\r\nan obstacle. Your going there is tough enough; carrying it with you will be\r\ntougher. You will be able to see time like you can see space; you develop a 4\r\ndimensional vision. The concept of distance vanishes for you. You can become\r\nsmall, like an atom and so vanish from vision; or become huge like a tower. The\r\nnotions of before and after lose their meaning. Is the nose of a dog earlier or\r\nlater than its tail? The only thing that survives perhaps is the topological\r\nconnectivity. In this sense, Karma has to be redefined as connected-ness of\r\nproximate areas in space-time. What is disjoint can\'t be connected; what is\r\nconnected can\'t be separated. But one can kill both (disjointedness and\r\nconnectedness) and start afresh. The freewill not only exists, but exists\r\nabsolutely.<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">What appears\r\nimpossible now may become ordinary in future, when people manage time like they\r\nmanage space. This is the promise of investigating into knowing who you are. <O:P>\r\n</O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">The next\r\nquestion: What is a particle? That which behaves like one, not like many\r\nparticles; even if it did consist of many. In my present state I don\'t look or\r\nfunction like a particle, because all the waves constituting me are so wide\r\napart, separate. I behave like a conglomerate, to which this simple approach\r\ndoesn\'t work. But suppose I work myself into a trance, a hypnosis, where all my\r\nthoughts are focused on one single thought, &quot; I am &quot; , then, I become\r\na particle and a coherent enough wave to which statistical thermodynamic laws\r\nwill not work. I eat up all time and space; they are in me. Distance in time or\r\nspace matters little, if I can move with infinite speed. I am everywhere at the\r\nsame time. I have an &quot; oceanic &quot; awareness. In such a state which\r\npeople call &quot;Samprajnata Samadhi&quot; , situations are created just by a\r\nthought. The thought is so powerful; it searches every nook and corner of the\r\nspace time world, and manifests it taking care of all consequences. I think\r\ncoherence is the key for bringing order back into our world; to wind the clock\r\nback and start afresh. We don\'t have to lament, time lost is gone for ever. Ever\r\nreformatted a disk and wrote it all over again?<O:P>\r\n </O:P>\r\n</font>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"COLOR: black\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Am I there? No,\r\ndefinitely not. Am I trying to be there? Yes I am trying. So I can\'t teach you\r\nall the things I am talking to you about.

Sword cuts the head, separating body from mind.\r\nIt can be interpreted also as wisdom, which separates, categorizes, and\r\nclassifies. So it is a symbol of knowledge. Khadgamala is about imagining a\r\ngarland of ideas, nourishing and protecting them and putting life into them.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">The Divine mother Life imagined\r\nthat there should be time, and time came to be. She chose to be the space, the\r\nwomb, in which time can move. Time and space going in whirls make matter. Time\r\nand space also provided the ground for vibrations of energy in the form of\r\nlight. Light preserves the present moment. The light was Sarasvati. Time - space\r\n- matter was classified by Her great will into life, sky, air, fire, water and\r\nearth and their properties in seed form. The Divine Mother imagined 14 stable\r\nworlds in an atom, and 14 worlds in cosmos. Then she felt this was enough and\r\nput a sphere around it.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">So far the creation had all the\r\nrichness of variety, forms of Lakshmi, but there was no action because time was\r\nlike space refusing to move. Everything was light. She created a great movement\r\nto time. Then time began to flow making all motions possible. She made the earth\r\nto move around the sun making years and moon around earth making the lunar\r\nmonth. Only if Life is coupled to time any form of experience can occur. Two\r\nexamples illustrate this. 1. We have life but we don\'t feel flowing time in\r\nsleep. 2. We have no life but time is flowing. In both these cases there is no\r\nexperience. So life has to be in continuous union with flowing time in order to\r\nhave any experience. Sometimes Life would separate from time and then there\r\nwould be no experience but rest.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Then she limited the fields of\r\ncosmic awareness making an individual. The individual separated from cosmos and\r\nsaid,&quot; I am so and so and these are mine and these are not mine.&quot;\r\nThere was <u>fear</u> and <u>desire</u> about what is not mine. If I did not get\r\nwhat I wanted, I felt helpless, <u>angry</u> and needed power. If I get the\r\ndesired object I was <u>greedy</u> and would not let it go. I <u>deluded</u>\r\ninto feeling I can’t live without it. I had the <u>pride</u> that I had it,\r\nand nobody else had it. I was <u>jealous</u> that others had things I did not\r\nhave. I was worried what I had would go away.&nbsp; All these passions: fear,\r\ndesire, anger, greed, attachment, delusion , pride, jealousy, spring from the\r\noriginal separation of myself from the world.&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">I was worried that I would die,\r\nand how can I go on after my life? I discovered food for extending my life. I\r\ndiscovered also that I could create new life forms through pleasure. So, sex was\r\nlike hunger, nourishing my need to extend my self beyond death. The Divine\r\nMother took the form of Kundalini and chose birth channel as her coiled abode\r\nready to uncoil and strike to transcend life and realizing my potential to be a\r\ncosmic being in space and time, before creation of life.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">The Khadgamala is the equation\r\nI=World=Beyond. Regular practice protects you, nourishes you, and takes you\r\nbeyond. It fulfils all wishes, more than you desire, <u>instantly</u>. Therein\r\nlies its power.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">How should you practice\r\nKhadgamala? As you are reciting each name, a portion of Sri Chakra should spring\r\nup in your imagination. The power comes from intensifying concentration to\r\nvisualize the form, hear the sound, feel the touch, taste, and smell of the\r\ndivine perfume of the goddess manifesting that part of the ever youthful\r\nGoddess. You can sit in front of each of the sculptures in Devipuram to get\r\ntraining into such visualizations. The Goddess loves fun. She is deeply in love\r\nwith You, making You Siva.</font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">So begin your journey to Goddess\r\ntoday, no matter how feebly.

In my case, I first<br>\nhad experience followed by an unshakable faith. Is it<br>\npossible to repeat this for everyone? I think not. This<br>\nlittle book gives some procedures which I found to work for<br>\nme as well as some others too. So, I hope they also give you<br>\nexperience of Goddess first so that faith can follow. These<br>\nprocedures are easy to follow by any one. You only have to<br>\nsuspend disbelief, pending discovery. If you practice<br>\nregularly every day, then you will be able to feel, then see<br>\nand then talk with the Mother Goddess like I was. And then,<br>\nyou will follow her instructions.<br>\nHow long it will take for this to happen ? If your attitudes<br>\nare pure and innocent like a child, may be about a month<br>\nwill do. Other wise it will take longer, say 30 months. You<br>\nmust commit yourself to doing every day at least some of the<br>\nprocedures given here, preferably all of them. You may need<br>\nto spend 1 to 1-1/2 hours to complete all of them. You may<br>\ndivide it into to three groups in whichever way and perform<br>\nat 6 A.M., 7 P.M. and 10 P.M.<br>\nThe procedures given here are all very powerful.<br>\nOccasionally you may have over-powering emotions, you may<br>\nnot be able to bear them. When Arjuna was seeing the<br>\nuniversal form of Krishna, he was afraid and could not bear<br>\nit. At such times, your Guru comes to your rescue. Guru can<br>\nbe a person who has given you Mantra Diksha, or a Sidha seen<br>\nin your meditations, or your favorite God or Goddess. In<br>\ncase you are afraid, you invoke their presence and energy<br>\ninto you; your fear will go. .<br>\n<br>\nAll Shaktis are in you but they are now asleep. The power of<br>\nseeing in eyes, hearing in ears, tasting in tongue, smelling<br>\nin nose, touching in skin, walking in feet, grasping in<br>\nhands,\nthinking in mind, feeling in heart, procreation in genitals;<br>\nlike this all powers are distributed in all parts of your<br>\nbody. They are working under the single power of life, which<br>\nwe call the Mother. If the life is missing or reduced in any<br>\npart of the body, that part can not function well. Even if<br>\nwe are fully awake, we are in a state of hypnosis and the<br>\npowers are not able to function well. For example, you are<br>\nable to touch what is near to you but not which is far.<br>\nSimilar is the case of seeing or hearing at a distance, the<br>\nability to know past, present &amp; future; and the ability to<br>\nenter another persons body and experience through the<br>\norgans of that body etc. All these powers are in you; but<br>\nthey are now sleeping. How do you awaken them? How do you<br>\nempower yourself to know your fullest potential ?<br>\n<br>\nWhat is needed is ATTENTION.<br>\n<br>\nATTENTION means the ability to focus the mind at a<br>\nparticular place or event to exclusion of all others. For<br>\nexample, Dronacharya asked Arjuna in a test of archery, ?<br>\nAre you seeing me?? Arjuna replied, ?No, I am not seeing<br>\nyou. Neither am I seeing any other person. The only thing<br>\nvisible is eye of the bird set up as a target?. That is what<br>\nwe mean by attention. Only the place or event that we are<br>\nfocusing on must be experienced. Nothing else must be<br>\nexperienced. It is such an attention that helps.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are able to pay such attention to all parts of your<br>\nbody, then the powers residing there will be awakened. The<br>\nunion of all such powers is Devi. DEVI MEANS YOUR LIFE. Only<br>\nif you have life, your eyes can see, ears can hear etc. So<br>\nplease understand that parts of your body are the real<br>\nShakti Pithas, the places where powers can be awakened.<br>\nWhen you sequence your undivided attention to all parts of<br>\nyour body, all powers of awareness will expand. When this<br>\nexpansion takes place, your life becomes powerful. You will<br>\nbe able to feel, see the mother goddess and become one with<br>\nHer. Along this path, you will experience closeness to Devi;<br>\nwill have a form like Her; you will be able to live in a<br>\nworld like Hers; and finally you will be able to attain the<br>\nhighest goal of moksha.<br>\nThe body needs work and the mind needs rest. For your health<br>\nto improve, for your body to become light, for your mind to<br>\nbecome free from the cage of your body and play freely in<br>\nthe worlds of Apsaras &amp; Devas and for you to be like them,<br>\nyou must decide and allow yourself freedom. Then only you<br>\nwill experience the Goddess. You must decide that you will<br>\nnot object to freedom from rules and regulations made by<br>\nother men who are not awakened and accepted unthinkingly by<br>\nyou.<br>\nEvery one desires freedom, unlimited happiness or wealth.<br>\nBut when such opportunities do come, their memories, social<br>\nstatus and fears of others disapproval become their<br>\nhandicaps. They bind themselves hand and foot by their own<br>\nthinking patterns. They suppress their independent thinking<br>\nand freedom and do not permit themselves unconditional love<br>\nand bliss. They continue to spend their lives in misery. To<br>\novercome such self made miseries and to set you free, some<br>\naffirmations are given at end. Read them every day and if<br>\nyou like them, make them your own. You open the seven golden<br>\ngates to freedom yourself this way.<br>\nFor direct experience of the goddess, this booklet may be<br>\nhelpful. Let go of doubts, fears and inhibitions.

(This<br>\nhas the effect of opening your inner 3rd eye. If you are<br>\nlooking at the Sun directly, please make sure only that the<br>\nred or orange Sun only is seen.

Sitting postures and Locks.<br>\nYou may sit at the edge of a seat with the edge of your<br>\nbuttocks resting on it, and keep your hands on your knee<br>\ncaps. Then your spine will become erect and you just can\'t<br>\nfall asleep. Or, if you have a back problem, you can rest<br>\nyour back against a wall with a pillow supporting the back.<br>\nThis should be OK. Both these postures allow you to forget<br>\nyour body and connect you to the wheel of power in the crown<br>\nof your head. The other posture which gives you a mild<br>\npleasure is the following. If you are a female of a light<br>\nbuild, press lightly your right or left heel into your<br>\nvagina. You are likely to experience sexual pleasure which<br>\nis desirable and not to be worried about. If you are of a<br>\nheavy build and unable to do so, you may make a ball of a<br>\nnapkin and sit on it in such a way that it has a similar<br>\neffect.<br>\nFor men the best posture is to press a heel lightly between<br>\nthe base of the penis and the testes such that a light<br>\nerection takes place. Or else, make a ball of a napkin and<br>\nsit on it to press on the ejaculatory sphincter muscle<br>\nbetween the testes and the anus. This posture does not allow<br>\nejaculation to take place. Technically it is the easiest<br>\nalternative to Siddha asana, the posture of attainment.<br>\nOnce you settle down in a sitting posture, there are two<br>\nmudras and two bandhas which you will practice, each seven<br>\ntimes. The first of the mudras is called Aswini, discovered<br>\nby observing the mare. This mudra repeatedly tightens, holds<br>\nand releases the anal muscles. The second mudra is called<br>\nShakti Chalana, which means moving the energy. This mudra is<br>\nsimilar; but works with muscles which control passage of<br>\nurine. To do this mudra properly, you have to observe first<br>\nwhat muscles are acting when passing urine and suddenly<br>\ncause the flow to stop. By repeatedly doing this you will<br>\nlearn to exercise the proper muscles only. The purpose of<br>\nboth these mudras is to arouse the desire for sex, but not<br>\nto satisfy it there. The desire has to be released by a<br>\nmental orgasm.<br>\nAfter exercising each mudra seven times, you do the anal<br>\nlock and tummy lock seven times each as follows. Take a deep<br>\nbreath filling the belly out like a woman in her late<br>\npregnancy, contract both the urinary and anal muscles, hold<br>\nit as long as comfortable, and release the breath with a<br>\nhissing ?Sssss? sound making it come out of a curled tongue<br>\nprojecting slightly out of the mouth. This is also called<br>\nthe Cobra breath, or the Kundalini breath by ancient Yogis.<br>\nThis is Mula bandha, the anal lock. The next step is to<br>\nexhale fully, pull the tummy in and up like a lion, exerting<br>\na pull on the muscles surrounding the gentals. This is<br>\ncalled Uddyana Bandha. Do each of these bandhas 7 times.</font></font>\n<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\"><br>\n3. Breathing exercises<br>\n</font>\n<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">\nYou should not do breathing exercises when the stomach is<br>\nheavy. Leave at least 2 hrs gap after meals. ?Ha Sa Kha?,<br>\nmantra for loosens bondage to your physical body and enables<br>\nastral travel. Let us use a slight variation of this<br>\nmantra,?Sa Kha Ha? which means ?She is your friend?.<br>\nBreathe in deeply with left nostril with the sound of ?Sa?<br>\nfilling the belly like a pregnant woman. Hold for half that<br>\ntime with the sound of ?Kha?. Release with the sound of ?Ha?<br>\nfrom the right nostril. Holding the breath outside, draw a<br>\ntriangle on the top palette with the tip of your tongue.<br>\nThis connects the Indra Yoni with the physical yoni. It is<br>\nis helpful in controlling the powerful Kundalini powers. Now<br>\nbreathe deeply in from the right nostril with ?Sa?, hold<br>\nwith ?Kha? and release with ?Ha? and draw the triangle, just<br>\nas before. This pair constitutes one breathing exercise. Do<br>\nthis seven times.<br>\n<br>\n4. Withdrawal.<br>\n<br>\nThis procedure removes the tensions and heals various organs<br>\nof your body and so allows you to escape from body<br>\nawareness. Sit comfortably in any easy posture described<br>\nabove. You may make an audio cassette of the following to<br>\nkeep track of timing and body parts and visualizations. You<br>\ncan also buy one made by Amrita. 1 min.

Guided visualization<br>\n<br>\nWait at each step till you are able to get a glimpse of the<br>\nimage. Don\'t strain too much; if it doesn\'t come, let it go.<br>\nNext time you sit, try to look at such pictures beforehand,<br>\nand try to recall them to your mind.<br>\nImagine that you are sitting near a small stream dangling<br>\nyour feet in it at the foot hills of Himalayas. You are<br>\nfeeling a little chill and also a little sweat due to the<br>\nafternoon Sun.<br>\n1. See a line of swans swiftly flying across the sky. 1min.<br>\n2. See the slowly flowing river near your feet. 1min.<br>\n3. See a small boulder around which water is gurgling. 3min.<br>\n4. See the the huge unmoving range of Himalayas. 1min.<br>\n5. Today is the full moon day. See the round moon rising on<br>\nthe silvery Himalayas. 2min.<br>\n<br>\n6. Flowing Awareness.<br>\n<br>\nFlowing awareness with form:<br>\nImagine that your Guru has materialized before you and<br>\nsitting next to you. Keep pressing the feet of your teacher<br>\nand keep talking, seeking answers to your doubts. Decide to<br>\nact according to the advice given.<br>\nNext imagine a red triangle with the angle pointing down. In<br>\nits center is a dancing red lingam which is emitting white<br>\nsparks upwards like Diwali crackers. Recall picture of<br>\nMuladhara wheel.<br>\nOR<br>\nImagine that some sages are doing a fire ritual in an<br>\nunderground temple, and the walls of the temple are<br>\nresounding the mantras being uttered. There is a huge image<br>\nof a Mother Goddess killing a demon seen in the light of the<br>\nfire. There are some women being worshipped by some sages,<br>\nseen in the light of fire.<br>\nOR<br>\nImagine your favorite Goddess or God or a good friend in<br>\nfront of you, and that you are chit chatting with them. See<br>\nthe visions they show you, or do what they ask you to do. If<br>\ninvited, even make love to them. If the last happens, you<br>\nwill derive immense benefits and siddhis; because through<br>\nmaking love, the energies are passed on which are of benign<br>\nnature.<br>\nOR<br>\nYou may be in the company of divine spirits or Apsaras or<br>\nYakshas. They enjoy free love. Join them, letting go of all<br>\nhuman inhibitions. Forget that you are a human being, and<br>\nremember your being a divine.<br>\n<br>\nFormless flow of awareness.<br>\n<br>\nTake 3 deep breaths. Let go of all ideas. See darkness.<br>\n<br>\n3min. If any thoughts come, don\'t judge them as good or bad.<br>\nInstead, you may ask, does this belong to the past or to the<br>\nfuture? Or am I imagining it? Remain a pure witness. 7min.<br>\nIf you get any emotion, try to remain a witness. Don\'t think<br>\nthat this emotion should be there, or that this should not<br>\nbe there. Be a mirror which reflects any thing good or bad<br>\nin front of it without choosing. Let go of all choices. If<br>\nfear takes hold of you, you help on hand ready by: 1. Pray<br>\nto your Guru, 2. Remember the wall of fire and confine the<br>\nfear into it. If none of these eliminates your fear, get up<br>\nfrom meditation, wash your hands, feet, eyes, and start<br>\nmeditation again.<br>\n<br>\nOr, you may get in touch with your teacher. Usually there<br>\nare no problems that cannot be solved with the help of your<br>\nGuru. Always remember that the deepest fears you have are<br>\nmere thoughts and so parts of you, and they can do no harm.<br>\nWhat is there to be afraid of about yourself? They will go<br>\naway, Now say, ?I am extremely happy here and now. My life<br>\nenergy is at its peak. I am full of enthusiasm, energy,<br>\nabundance and love. I express my gratitude to all who are<br>\nhelping me. I am blessed. I bless the whole world.?<br>\nGet up from meditation and put down in a dairy all the<br>\nthoughts and feelings you have seen or experienced. They<br>\nwill help you in defining the goals of your life and<br>\ndeciding your future course of actions.<br>\n<br>\n7. Creating an Astral body.<br>\n<br>\nThis is also a guided visualization. Through this procedure,<br>\nyou will 1. loosen the idea that you are limited only by<br>\nyour body, and therefore become less sensitive to pain and<br>\npleasure, insult and praise, cold and heat; 2. continue to<br>\nexist as a light form lasting for as long as the world<br>\nexists, and through that keep, helping others and receive<br>\nworship as Goddess Herself. Sit comfortably. Take a deep<br>\nbreath three times. Repeat the following in your mind. Try<br>\nto visualize as clearly as you can. This is an initiation.<br>\nEvery initiation goes through a gate; here it is the gate of<br>\ndeath and the gate of birth into a new life. This body has<br>\nto decay some day. Imagine it dead here and now. All people<br>\nknown to me, friends and relatives have come to see my body<br>\nfor the last time. They went round my body three times and<br>\nprayed for my soul, and each one poured some water on my<br>\nbody. The body is tied to a wooden frame. There is one<br>\nperson carrying an earthen pot of water in front; a<br>\nprocession of my near and dear followed, to the chants of<br>\nNarayana, Narayana. They carried it to the cremation<br>\nground, where there is a funeral pyre ready to receive it.<br>\nThe frame is kept on the fire wood, all ties removed with<br>\nclothes. We come naked into the world, and we go naked from<br>\nit. Camphor is placed in all holes of the body, some sandal<br>\nwood is placed on the chest, and some small pieces of wood<br>\nand then large pieces. The camphor is lighted. Sense the<br>\nsmell of burning camphor, and see smoke, little lights of<br>\ncamphor, the smell of burning sandalwood, see sparks, small<br>\npieces of wood lighting up, then the bigger flames. The<br>\nperson carrying the earthen pot of water went round the<br>\nburning pyre 3 times, and threw the pot to the ground. The<br>\npot of water is a symbol of a body containing the life. Pot<br>\nis broken, water spilled out and it soaked the earth. Life<br>\nwhich came from earth is returned to it. As the body is<br>\nburning, all that belongs to it, namely the feelings of<br>\nfear, hate, shame, aversion, class, belongings, family,<br>\nrelationships, all went back to wherever they came from. I<br>\nam witnessing all this. So, strangely, I could not have<br>\ndied. How can there be death for life? Only the body has<br>\ndeath and decay. We change bodies as simply as changing<br>\nclothes. The fire has meanwhile burnt up the whole body. All<br>\nthat remains of it is just a handful of ashes. It is these<br>\nashes that are worn by Siva as an ornament.<br>\nWhat can this ash need? Does it have any fear? Desires?<br>\nAnger or lust or greed or pride or jealousy? Does it know<br>\nany good or bad even? Truth or untruth? Nothing whatsoever.<br>\nBe in that state of absolute silence for 2 to 3 minutes.<br>\nMeanwhile, from somewhere black clouds gathered in the sky.<br>\nThe whole atmosphere suddenly cooled down and the cool<br>\nbreeze of impending rain blew. Devi was shining forth as<br>\nlightning flashes from the sky to earth, and drops of rain<br>\nstarted falling to the ground. The earth thrilled to the<br>\ndrops, and emitted the sweet smell of mud wet with the rain.<br>\nA divine downpour of cool nectarine rain fell on the ashes.<br>\nBecause it was nectar the ashes took on a new form. What<br>\nkind of a form was that? Like the ball of red Sun rising<br>\nfresh on the eastern horizon early in the morning, climbing<br>\nslowly up, and changing into bright orange, then extremely<br>\nbright white light against the blue sky, but strangely<br>\nwithout the usual heat at all. It came on top of my head,<br>\ndescended, became a ball of brilliant white light of 5?<br>\ndiameter and 9? above the head. It stayed there for some<br>\ntime, descended into my head, and I am experiencing a cool<br>\nbright shower of white light in my head. It came down<br>\nthrough my neck, and settled prettily in my heart. My heart<br>\noverflowed with joy. There it is emitting millions of<br>\nflashes of lightning of all colors of the rainbow: violet,<br>\nindigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. My whole body<br>\nbecame the body of light, filled from head to foot. The ball<br>\nof light split into two, became Devi and Siva. Siva is lying<br>\nflat on the lotus in my heart, and Devi is sitting on top of<br>\nhim in union with Him. The thrill of their union filled my<br>\nbody. Out of the joy of intercourse came this world of<br>\nliving beings, it lives for that joy, and when the body<br>\nbecomes old and cannot sustain life, abandons it to get a<br>\nnew body.<br>\nNow my body is emitting all colors like flashes from every<br>\npointed end of my body; toes, fingers, nipples, eyes. Who<br>\never is coming into contact with these flashes is being<br>\nfilled with peace of mind, vitality, strength, pleasure,<br>\nwealth, fulfillment of all desires, friendship with all,<br>\nerotic pleasures, healing of all diseases of body and mind.<br>\nKeep your hand on your heart and say ?Aam Soham, Aam Soham,<br>\nAam, Soham?.<br>\n<br>\n8. Opening and harmonizing the Energy wheels.<br>\n<br>\nThere are seven spinning wheels of energy in you. If you pay<br>\nattention to the actions given below carefully and remember<br>\nthem, you will experience these spinning wheels.<br>\n1. Muladhara wheel. (Link to picture)<br>\nThere is a square wheel between anus and the vagina or the<br>\nbase of the penis. There is a rose color triangle in it. In<br>\nits center there is a red phallus moving up and down<br>\nemitting white sparks of semen continuously. There is the<br>\nKundalini Shakti, the Serpent Power coiled round the phallus<br>\nand drinking the semen being ejaculated. This is the<br>\nstarting point of the supreme energy of the cosmos<br>\nmanifesting creation. Imagine a sound ?Lang? starting from<br>\nthis square wheel and rising up to the crown of the head.<br>\nWhen you are pronouncing this sound, the upper part of the<br>\ntongue touches the deep upper palette. You must feel that<br>\ntouch. Do like this for all the other sounds in other<br>\nwheels.<br>\n2. Swadhishtana, six petal wheel. (Link to Picture)<br>\nThis is the sex center. A trishul shaped like a yoni is<br>\nwithin a six petal wheel. It has an orange color and a<br>\nwhite moon adorns it. At this place, the vibrations of sex<br>\nkeep going round and round like a wheel. This is the<br>\noriginal seat of the transcendental Goddess, and the meaning<br>\nof ?Swadhistana? is that the Shakti resides there. From<br>\nthere, the sound of Vang&nbsp; rises to the crown. This is the<br>\nseed sound of nectar, being a rose color, a mixture of<br>\nsemen-white and blood-red. The clitoris is the seat of<br>\nKundalini, identifiable with the Snake God Kumara.<br>\n3. Manipura, the belly button wheel. (Link to Picture)<br>\nThere is a 10 petal wheel around the waist, shining like<br>\nfire with yellow and orange colors. From here to the crown<br>\nthe sound of ?Rang? keeps spreading. Repeat this sound seven<br>\ntimes. This is the wheel of fire which transforms lust into<br>\npower. When the ejaculation in men and orgasm in women is<br>\ncontrolled, the Kundalini power does not get its nectar from<br>\nthe semen or blood; it uncoils, moves up in search of nectar<br>\nand shoots up to the wheel in the crown where it gets the<br>\nnectar from the moon there. What this means is that the<br>\nphysical orgasm is replaced by a spiritual orgasm; the<br>\nintercourse takes place in the mind, and a supreme<br>\nrelaxation occurs in the form of a spiritual explosion of<br>\nall colors. Some times spiritual aspirants actually see a<br>\nhooded cobra dancing in front of their eyes. It represents<br>\nthe intense sexual energy and the fears associated with it;<br>\nnothing more. So there is absolutely no cause for fear if<br>\nyou come across such experiences. Remember Kumara the<br>\nserpent power has as its vehicle the peacock, the born enemy<br>\nof snake!<br>\n4. Anahata, the wheel of unconditional love. (Link to<br>\nPicture)<br>\nThere is a 12 petal wheel circulating in air around the<br>\nchest. It has yellows and greens, the colors of vegetation.<br>\nFrom here to the crown, the sound of ?Yang? spreads; say it<br>\nseven times. By sharing our powers with others, we enter<br>\nthis wheel of unconditional love. We give because it is our<br>\nnature to share; we give without expecting any returns<br>\nwhatsoever. This wheel brings unbounded prosperity to you,<br>\nwhich grows more and more by giving.<br>\n<br>\n5. Visuddhi, the wheel of astral communication in space.<br>\n(Link to picture)<br>\nThere is a 16 petal wheel around the space in your neck. It<br>\nhas light and dark blue colors like the sky. It spins to<br>\nthe sound of ?Hang? which spreads to the crown. Utter this<br>\nsound 7 times. By placing attention here, you will acquire<br>\npowers like hearing at a distance, seeing far away places,<br>\ntalking with spirits, Apsaras, Angels, Goddesses and Gods.<br>\nThis is the wheel of communication in space across immense<br>\ndistances. The ability to enter another person and know the<br>\nexperiences as your own is obtained by prolonged practice of<br>\npaying attention to this wheel.<br>\n6. Ajna, the wheel of time.&nbsp;<br>\nThere is a 2 petal lotus between the eye-brows. Focus here<br>\nto go across time.<br>\n7. Sahasrara, the wheel in the crown of your head. There is a<br>\n1000 petal wheel in the head, the brain wheel. It has the<br>\ncolors of blue and violet and also all colors of rainbow in<br>\na lesser degree. From here the sound of Hreem keeps<br>\nemitting light beams flashing above the head.<br>\n8. Guru Paduka, wheel of the Supreme being, Yourself. There<br>\nis the wheel of the feet of the Supreme Guru 9 inches above<br>\nyour head. It is in the center pod of the Sahasrar above.<br>\nThe feet have the letters Hasaum and Sahauh. They are<br>\nsurrounded by an eight petal lotus. Each petal is abundance<br>\nbeyond measure, some times also called Ashta Lkashmis and<br>\nalso Sudarshana. They are filled with millions of round<br>\ndisks of all colors arranged in the form of worlds in<br>\ngeometric patterns. By focusing your attention on any disk<br>\nyou will be able to gain entry into that world, becoming its<br>\ncreator Brahma, sustainer Vishnu, and Dancer Siva.<br>\nThe half female, half male form of Sakti Siva -Ardha Nari<br>\nIswara is standing on top of your head, facing the same<br>\ndirection as you, and the feet above your head belongs to<br>\nthis form. In this form, the creator Siva is eternally<br>\nsurrounded by own Yoni, emitting an unending life giving<br>\nstream called Ganga. The divine form of this nectar is<br>\nTime. The earthly forms of this nectar are the juices of<br>\nsex. The physical orgasm loses life energy and ends in a<br>\nvery short time. But a spiritual orgasm has no end. It is<br>\ncalled ?Brahma ananda, the bliss of creation. The sound of<br>\nthis creation is like that of an ocean, ?Om?. Suppose there<br>\nare a million people in a gathering, each talking to their<br>\nneighbors. There is an ocean of sound rising from that<br>\ncommunion. The sound of Om is like that. Your aim is to<br>\nraise yourself above your head, merge into that form, and<br>\nexperience unending spiritual orgasm which you may call is<br>\nthe dance of the Galaxies, the dance of rising water falls,<br>\ndivine light and sound show. The joy you experience will<br>\nshower your whole body with a thrill never known before.<br>\nExperience there is indescribable. You are literally taking<br>\nbath in these nectarine waters of life. It is totally free<br>\nfrom tension, very much unlike a physical orgasm. But it<br>\nsatisfies a million times more. Stay in this state as long<br>\nas you can; there can be no higher happiness than this. What<br>\nhappens then? You are no more in control. There is no you to<br>\nbe in control. You only experience a feeling, and visions.<br>\nIt is like you had an intense multiple orgasm, you are<br>\nthoroughly satisfied, your body has lost all weight, it is<br>\nfloating away without walls and ceiling being obstacles, it<br>\nis being carried by rainbows, you are rising above the city<br>\nyou are dwelling, the country, the oceans, the earth, beyond<br>\nthe Moon, the Sun, entered the star field, the constellation<br>\nof Seven Sages (Great Bear), Dhruva (Pole star), beyond<br>\nGalaxies, the worlds, and entered the abode of Mother<br>\nGoddess, an island of jewels. Witness the playful, and<br>\nerotic fun and frolic, singing and dancing, and enjoy the<br>\nmultiple partners without inhibitions. You enter the source<br>\nof the cosmos, Sri Yantra in the womb of the divine<br>\nMother. You become a part of Her to live in waves of beauty,<br>\nSoundarya Lahari If I seem to be carried away, it is true,<br>\nI am carried away. I had no will of my own. At the will of<br>\nthe Mother Goddess who loves erotic sentiments (Rati priya)<br>\nbecause Eros is pro-life, I have put down these few thoughts<br>\nfor you to consider seriously and practice.<br>\n<br>\n9. Affirmations.<br>\n<br>\n1. My body is a temple. All parts of my body are made by<br>\nGoddess and are divine. They are seats of all powers:<br>\nmanifest and latent. They are the real Sakti Peethas.<br>\n2. Sex is sacred. It is the source of life. Genitals are<br>\nsacred. I worship them as Siva and Sakti.<br>\n<br>\n3. Sri Chakra is located in all the female genitals at the<br>\nclitoris. It has been called the Jewel in the Lotus. It is<br>\nmost sacred, and secret, yet known to every one. I worship<br>\nthe Sri Chakra, a circle of devotees to connect me to the<br>\nsource of cosmos.<br>\n<br>\n4. Whatever whatever sins I committed, I did in a state of<br>\nignorance. Then I was in a hypnosis. Now I am awake. This<br>\nawakened being did not commit those things. I do not feel<br>\nshame, nor will I punish myself for what I was. Past is<br>\npast, gone for ever. I forgive myself, as I forgive all<br>\nothers the wrongs they did to me. Now I can laugh at my<br>\nmistakes, and others ignorance. Is a five year old less than<br>\na ten year old? All are evolving. I don\'t have to hate<br>\nignorance. Darkness cant be where light is.<br>\n<br>\n5. I love myself. I deserve love. I deserve riches. I<br>\ndeserve joy, happiness, health. I have them. I share them. I<br>\nwill see people\'s happiness.<br>\n<br>\n6. I will think of Goddess always. In my sadness, in my<br>\npleasure. More so in my pleasure, because that is when I<br>\ntend to forget Her.<br>\n7. My mother, father, guru, guests, relatives and friends,<br>\nand all help me; I express my gratitude for their help every<br>\nday mentally and through actions. I will serve them with<br>\ncompassion. 8. Even my enemies have life; and life is Devi.<br>\nSo I respect them, forgive them, and try to look at their<br>\npoint of view and make friends. If I can\'t do it, I will<br>\nlove them all the same, do not reject them, but maintain a<br>\nrespectful distance. My love does not expect that they<br>\nshould love me in return. It has no conditions attached. I<br>\nshare because I like sharing. That is all. 9. Expressing<br>\nlove through thought word and deed are the sure means for<br>\nunlimited abundance, health, and pleasure. It is my birth<br>\nright to enjoy these good things of life. 10. In every<br>\noutgoing breath, my anxieties and worries are getting out.<br>\nWith every incoming breath, peace is coming in. I am happy<br>\nhere and now. I have plenty of energy flowing through me. I<br>\nam enjoying bliss, energy, wealth, love and pleasure<br>\nindependent of external circumstances.<br>\nMark those that appeal to you. Repeat them every day and<br>\nmake them your own. You will see your life change in<br>\nperceptible ways.<br>\n<br>\nAmrita 1998<br>\n<br>\n\n</font>'),(12,'Here Come Angels','<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\"><u><b><font size=\"3\">Here Come Angels<img border=\"0\" src=\"angel.gif\" width=\"94\" height=\"139\"></font></b></u></font></p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font color=\"#000080\">\r\nGanapathy blowing conch.

Sounds of thunder. Bolts\r\nof lightning. Winds raising dust. First drops of\r\nwater falling. Sweet smell of earth hungry for<br>\r\nrain. Sounds of lashing rain.&nbsp; More thunder, more\r\nlightning.  Sahasrakshi appears in a lightning.\r\nRadiant, glowing, smiling.  Zoom into Her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speaks: Her lips don\'t move, but She speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        I come to this world to spread the wings\r\n        of love and make you fly like angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        I am the energy of love, life and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Surrender to me. I will lead you to the\r\n        realization that you are God, You are me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        There is no you, no me. We are one. That\r\n        is the truth. Love brings people together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Respect love. Do not degrade it with anger\r\n        violence or lust. Making love is my worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        This earth torn by fear. I bring my angels to\r\n        help you with your journey to greatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Do not resist them. They are here to help\r\n        in your darkest hours of melancholy.

Who created God then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreation implies that there was nothing \"before\" and<br>\r\nsomething came into being \"after\".  \"Before\" and<br>\r\n\"after\" are terms which have a meaning only with<br>\r\nrespect to time.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo we look at a book and say, it is born at this<br>\r\ncorner and died at this other corner? The book is not<br>\r\nflowing, like time is flowing.  If we scan it through<br>\r\na slot then it does simulate the behavior of life and<br>\r\ndeath.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"creation\" is in the domain of flowing time.<br>\r\nSince God exists as pure existence beyond time, the<br>\r\nconcept of creation does not apply to God, which is<br>\r\nbeyond time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe can and should ask what created the world; because<br>\r\nthe world of experience has had a beginning and it will<br>\r\nhave an ending in time; it is flowing in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe implication is that existence can have two<br>\r\nmodes:  \"unaware\" and \"aware\".  The \"unaware\" state<br>\r\ncontains the \"aware\" state. \"Unaware\" is like the<br>\r\ncenter watching the \"aware\" circle.  Without the<br>\r\ncenter, the circle cannot be; yet it is not a part of<br>\r\nthe circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the awareness of God, the life of God, which<br>\r\nexpresses itself in space, time and matter. Pure<br>\r\nexistence, unaware of its existence, looks like<br>\r\nnon-existence. It is like zero, Shoonya. Yet it is<br>\r\ncapable of manifesting aware existence. How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet us look at the example of zero.  Zero can just be a<br>\r\nzero; it can also be a sum of equal and opposite<br>\r\nattributes (3.1416 + (-3.1416)).  Any number of such<br>\r\npairs of opposites (duals) can come out of the original<br>\r\nzero; yet, it does not lose its potency to create fresh<br>\r\npairs, it is not exhausted, it is not consumed.  The<br>\r\nzero is not like food, which is consumable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is simply no way we can distinguish a \"pure zero\"<br>\r\nfrom an \"impure zero\" that came as the sum of a pair of<br>\r\nequal and opposite attributes.  The best we can say is<br>\r\nthat they are mutual attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese philosophical questions are further explored now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

It was a bird’s eye view of Mani Dveepa meaning an Island of Jewels.\r\nLustrous Goddesses like Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati dance there with 64\r\nYoginis &amp; Apsaras. All are well versed in the 64 arts of expressing love.\r\nEach one more beautiful than the others, they dance and laugh and play\r\nhalf-clothed. Heavenly courtesans like Rambha, Urvasi, Menaka and Tilottama go\r\nabout unclothed demonstrating the 64 arts of passionate lovemaking as gateways\r\nto liberation. There is neither any sense of shame nor doubt nor any criticism. <o:p>\r\n</o:p>\r\n</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Mani\r\nDveepa is the great pleasure resort of Goddesses. Kali’s attendants guard the\r\nentrance so that no male entity could gain entry.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>All male Gods were kept out, including Brahma and Vishnu. They approached\r\nShiva and prayed to him. “O Lord, We are not allowed to see this great\r\ncarnival of Goddesses. Terrible Kali Herself is protecting the entry.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp;\r\n</span>Please see with your divine vision what is happening there and at least\r\ndescribe in words the pleasures and games of Devis. Shiva told them: “This is\r\nDevi’s play, Her Maya. I cannot fathom it. Parvati has prevented my entry\r\nalso. I tried seeing with my divine eye. Alas, it does not work.” Then the\r\nGods told Shiva. “If that be the case, Oh Lord! This will be the first time\r\nthe great God Shiva who is a Sarvajna, the knower of all, is prevented from\r\nknowing something” <o:p>\r\n</o:p>\r\n</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Then\r\nShiva understood their concern and took the form of a 2-year-old baby to enter\r\nthe Mani Dveepa. The gatekeepers and the dancers saw him and said, Oh! It is\r\nonly a 2-year-old baby. He does not know anything about sex. He is liberated,\r\nbeing shameless himself. Let him come in. Shiva entered and saw the totally open\r\nbeauty of the Goddesses. He has seen what no one else has seen about the\r\nplayfulness of the divine beauties. He experienced the ultimate in beauty and\r\npleasure. He saw how the Bhairavis play with each other. He came to know how\r\nParvati enjoys in Mani Dveepa, which he could never see in Himalayas. Shiva\r\nhimself is totally uninhibited. The pleasure he saw got into his head. He\r\nstarted dancing wildly and started playing inimitably on his drum. <o:p>\r\n</o:p>\r\n</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Soon\r\nParvati’s eyes fell on this child prodigy, for how can talent be hidden? The\r\ncrescent moon hidden in his locks was seen by Parvati. She understood that Shiva\r\nhimself came in disguise. The secret doors to whatever the ladies wanted to hide\r\nhave been opened. Every lady opens herself to the linga, and so is nude in front\r\nof Shiva. But for the sake of the world she has to show the sense of shame. So\r\nwhat to do now? All ladies conferred and quickly decided that somehow what Shiva\r\nhad seen must be a closed vision to the rest of the world. So all of them said\r\nin one voice: let us freeze his age at two and make him our son. A son never\r\nreveals the secret of his mother even if she misbehaves. All the Yoginis lifted\r\ntheir skirts and placed him in their laps. They taught him the ten great vidyas\r\nfor liberation. He became the universal son to all the Yoginis, Lakshmi, Parvati,\r\nSaraswati, Apsaras, Courtesans, Devis and their sub-Devis. Like this they bound\r\nShiva’s expression. Shiva<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>could\r\nnot describe what he saw being only two years old. All the Gods were stunned.\r\nWhat is this? He was a man and now he is a child attached to his mothers. Their\r\ndesire to see the pleasures of Goddesses was not satisfied. This is the story\r\nfrom Purana.

Why now? People are seeing orgies\r\nsecretly. It is better if they accept it publicly to get rid of their neuroses.\r\nLust is necessary, for it is the spring of life. Given the suicidal technology,\r\nthere is great danger in coupling lust to violence. The need of the hour is to\r\nexpress lust through all fine arts: like song, dance, sculpture, painting and\r\ndevotion.

P. Sastry) performed a Devi Yaga in Vizag in april 1983. At that time a 3 acre plot was donated at a place we call Devipuram now. It is in Sabbavaram Mandal, Vizag\r\nDistrict, A.P. He used to come here. There were no roads, no water, no way. He was looking for confirmation that this was the place intended for the Devi temple he wanted to\r\nbuild. He discovered an oval rock about 9 feet with a triangular with a 6 ft pit in it. It had the features of a female genital. It was obviously cut by human hands long time ago. He used to meditate there. He went into a trance and saw Devi Kamakhya in front of him. When he accepted Her invitation to do puja, she opened herself to him and initiated him into ancient erotic rituals. She inspired him to build three temples: one for\r\nHerself, one for Father, and one for Sri Chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kamakhya Guru Peetham was built by him around the oval rock in 1983. Temple for Siva was built on top of the hill the same time. Then Sri Meru was completed in 1994 in the donated land. Kamakhya showed him in meditation the goddesses of Sri\r\nChakra. He could describe them to the sculptor. This article is what Kamakhya Devi told him. In essence, it describes how acceptance of\r\nEros can heal, empower women and men. Eros is seen in the context of freedom and social empowerment.</font><br>\r\n&nbsp;</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"SriChakra3.jpg\" width=\"216\" height=\"216\"></font></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">&nbsp;<font color=\"#800080\">                             \r\n<u>KAMAKHYA TOLD AMRITA</u></font></font></p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n<font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">\r\nKamakhya told Amrita: \"In the olden days enjoying sex was a proper aim of life and so Kama was sacred. Kama was the God of Love, same as Siva, with Rati, myself, happiness of sexual union, being his wife. Use of erotic rituals used to be performed to pleasure me. They are carved in all sacred temples. Eros is pro-life. It is the fountain of semen, blood, milk and white and pink light which sustains passion, joy, creativity, power and love. This method of worship is available to every one. It is the easy path to me. My name means sex desire. I am the source of all life.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many temples for me which are following Dakshinachara available only to elite Brahmins. But I am life in every one, not only the elite. I love fun, I am very sexual, I am pro-life. So I am in everyone as erotic desire. I am accessible to everyone who has passion for sex. I am there in Deva Dasis, and prostitutes also. Every woman, no matter what her state in life is, has the right to be worshipped. She only has to ask for it as I did to you. Make sure that Her decency is not violated. No one should be forced, compelled or bribed into the puja. Only volunteering adults may willingly and joyously participate in my erotic rituals called chakra pujas without any sense of shame. The female genital is my temple. I should be worshipped there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should the worship be done? I accept all enjoyments as worship. Enjoyment doesn\'t hurt anyone. My puja can be done simply, or elaborately. You may worship me through any consenting woman thus: Inviting, offering a\r\nseat, washing hands, offering water and milk to drink, sensual massage with herbal oils followed by bath, anointing all body parts with perfumes, offering lovely clothes, makeup, ornaments, scented flowers and decorations to every part of the body, giving delicacies to eat, and waving lights. Then I will bless you through the woman receiving the puja to fulfill all your desires if they involve no injury to any one. All the time the puja is going on, any potent mantras like the\r\nthousand names of any Goddess should be recited or heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have blessed the world. So there should be an orgy of celebration, with singing and dancing and fine arts. I will put life into all your arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such pujas done to women are the core of bhakti to me. They empower the women receiving the puja to become divine. I am pleased by such pujas. Inhibitions, or sense of shame are creations of ego; sense of I and mine. At least for the duration of puja, people should let go of them in the temples here and everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no restriction really that only husbands should worship their wives. What was the relationship between you and your wife before marriage? Any one could have been your spouse, right? If such restriction were to be placed, puja would never happen with real bhakti. What is puja without bhakti? Husbands may not like their women to become free, to be liberated. If only husbands are allowed to do puja to their wives and they are unwilling to do it, or the wives don\'t like to be worshipped by others because tradition goes against it, how can they ever receive the adoration and love they deserve? Should they then miss the opportunity to be adored at least once in their life time to be a Goddess? In this age, billions of women need to become free of domination from bondage and aggression. You need a society free from male AND female domination. How this can happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know in this age of repression of women, worship is considered obscene. Why can\'t you make love in temples like in olden days? Who teaches you the fine arts of satisfying the partner if both partners are ignorant? Must you learn from dull,\r\nrepetitive pornographic films and books secretly with a feeling of sin? Why did the fine arts of erotic rituals involving transformation of lust to love become wrong and became black magic? What kind of legal norms are you having if it doesn\'t object to fighting, injuring and rape being shown publicly while love play is forbidden? How come you have become so anti-life and pro-death? Did your Vedas or Shastras prescribe violence as a purushartha? Can guns and weapons feed or educate a poor child, or heal a single suffering person?&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that Shiva\'s emblem is Ananda Bhairava, the unhooded penis Linga, that my temple is the life giving womb Garbha, that Ganapathi stands at the G-spot, that Kundalini- Kumara\'s seat is the clitoris, and that the vehicle of Shiva is the testes? Did you know that flowers are the genitals of trees, holy ashes represents semen and kumkum the menstrual flow? Did you know that love play is my puja? Why should you be ashamed of your rich culture which is pro-life and sexy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw away your inhibitions, do what you feel is right openly. Change your laws, it is high time. Have one law for every one; treat all equally. Make violence, weapons of mass destruction, illegal and unlawful. Divert the resources from creating mass destruction to educate, empower and enrich the lives of people. You have my blessings. Nudity is the symbol of having nothing to hide, being open to being loved. Let people be nude in the temples if they so wish. And be worshipped like that. The whole of nature is nude except you silly humans. Move into a world of love and light, not alienation and darkness. Allow yourselves to enjoy. Enjoyment is virtue. Misery is sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For worship to yield fruit, some form of energy exchange has to be there. The best form is service. The person being empowered should repay the debt through some form of service to the Goddess temple. The best service is to convince people that loving is empowering, that puja really empowers women and men by making them\r\nGoddesses and Gods, who are able to create a new world order of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is Ok to be nude. It is Ok to have fun with a willing partner. It is Ok to give a ritual bath to a woman. It is Ok to see people enjoying good sex. Temples are indeed the places for promoting social intercourse and empowerment. It is Ok to know that ejaculation and orgasm can be and are different. It is Ok to practice from a learned Guru the fine arts of worshipping Goddess.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If people object to these values, they may go to another place. There is no compulsion to come here. There is no adversity that will come to them if they don\'t come here. Let people\r\nexercise their choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initially people will listen but shake their heads in disbelief. They will leer, they will say it is nonsense, they will say this will destroy culture and\r\ncivilized behavior. That is normal, because that is how they have been programmed by society. When entire population of the world want sex and like to show it and see it at least in their privacy, how can it be abnormal? As the society\r\nrealizes the roots of its ills, more and more people will start accepting these ways. It is not your job to convince people. They will have to convince themselves, shed their inhibitions for enjoyments. There is more hope with the younger generation than old people with set attitudes. You must\r\nreach out to adolescents, and explain the concepts of sexual fulfillment. There is more hope with villagers who are in tune with nature than urbanites. So I have chosen this rural setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every one tells you, what will other people think? How will you be judged? How will it reflect on the society? They will try to imprison you, poison you, kill you. Don\'t ever worry about that. There is no such thing as death. You are already in a life long prison called your body, mind and ego. One more prison around it doesn\'t matter. If you know how to get out of the prison of your body, no prison can hold you. Let people judge you as they think fit. All that matters is are you convinced \"this is the way\"? Make information available to them. You tell people, but don\'t compel them. People will bring\r\nbouquets and brickbats. You don\'t have to change. Be firm in your belief. It is not even belief. A fact can\'t be reduced to belief. You don\'t have to believe in something you know first hand to be true. I will bring the right people to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have sent many many people before you. I will keep sending more. I am the way. I am the gate of life, the maker of life, the yoni, the source of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, these are the words that Goddess spoke to Amrita. Take it or leave it. Think it is true or false. It doesn\'t matter. Come here if you like. Don\'t come if you don\'t like. Nobody compels you. Only try to see for yourself. Don\'t blindly accept what others say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most important differences between an ordinary orgasm with ejaculation\r\nand TANTRIC orgasm without ejaculation are illustrated in the\r\nfollowing comparative analysis:</font></p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"50%\"><u> <font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\"> ORDINARY ORGASM</font></u>\r\n      <p> <font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\"> (with ejaculation)</font></td>\r\n    <td width=\"50%\"><u>                       <font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">                       TANTRIC ORGASM</font></u>\r\n      <p>                    <font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">                    (without ejaculation)</font></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"50%\"><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Explosion (outward-bursting energy).</font>\r\n      <p><font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\" color=\"#000080\">Inevitably, the erotic energy is lost permanently and uselessly.

Shakti is the known.  They appear to be separated in space and/or in time. An interval measures the\r\ndistance in space and time together. More precisely,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Interval)squared = (Distance)squared - (Time difference x c)<br>\r\nsquared. c is the speed of light = 186000 miles/second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAikya means union. They were not united, but now we unite them.<br>\r\nMeaning, we reduce the interval between them to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAikya Rupini means having the form of union. Form of what? Form<br>\r\nof the zero interval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two ways this interval can be zero. First way is to make distance and time difference both zero. That is, the\r\nseer and seen are at the same place and same time, that is,\r\nthey are one and the same.  This is just the state of being. There is no power in that, not even the desire or the power to\r\nmove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second way is that space and time differences exist, but they are equal.  The interval vanishes when\r\nspacial interval = time interval x c. This is the interesting case of dynamic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiva is the power of being.  Shakti is the power of awareness, desiring, knowing and manifesting.  When these two merge, it\r\nbecomes total power to be anywhere/anytime, to desire, to know&nbsp;how to and to manifest the desire, any desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the secret of this great mantra. This teaches us how to become total power. Power to be, power to know, power to heal,\r\nacross great distances or time intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, we can be any place we want in zero time. Teleporting. Not physically of course, but mentally. We don\'t\r\neven have to know the path, because we are not going along any path; there is no path. We don\'t need telephone lines; sky will\r\ndo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, we can do absent healing.  For doing this two conditions are necessary.  First, our\r\nform must be made of light, so that we can move with the speed of light, then time freezes\r\nfor us, and then distance does not matter.  We can be anywhere in zero time.  Second, the desire to heal should exist.  Then\r\nhealing is automatic; for, what disease can afflict light?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you become light and wish to manifest any thing anywhere, you will manifest it. A universe, if you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a physical being, we are not made of light. As a mental being we are made of light.  This is how the power of visualization\r\nmanifests the visualized.  This is where visual symbols, called\r\nyantras come in.  They are our mental visualizations, so they are made of light.  They have the intelligence of cosmic power\r\nworking through them.  All forms are yantras.  They create space,\r\ntime and matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis great mantra teaches us that all powers are in us. It is for us to find out what we want and use the\r\nspiritual techniques to get what we want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet us consider some practical examples of applying the mantra and the yantra embedded in the mantra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the yantra suggested/embedded in the mantra? That she has the form of the union of Shiva and Shakti. The physical form we\r\ncan relate to manifesting our desire is to think that the linga and yoni are in union. Geometrically we can think that the\r\ntriangle is the yoni (Shakti), and the circle inscribed in it is the shaft (Shiva).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we go from here? The place we want to go to is different from where we are, right? So it has an interval, think of that as\r\nthe yoni. I, as Shiva, have to place myself there in it, to\r\nachieve the unity of Shiva and Shakti. So what is the visualization? First I imagine the triangle. Then I go into that\r\ntriangle and visualize the place I want to be, not worrying about the path. Presto, I am there with an astral presence. Those who\r\ncan calm their minds, can see me there, talk to me, do whatever they want with me, love me, or kill me even; but I am here too.\r\nSo I may be dead there, but alive here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, wait a minute. Suppose I want to heal the relationship of a woman and man, and I am a woman. I can map her into my yoni and\r\nhim as a linga entering it, witnessing the union of Shiva and Shakti. Their relationship gets healed. The difference from the\r\nprevious example is that I am not going anywhere; I am mapping their presence into me.</font></font>\r\n');
